# Reversals

Mistakes happen. Autumn makes it easy to reverse moderation actions cleanly.

## `!unban`
Revoke a ban for a user, allowing them to rejoin the server.

**Usage:**
```bash
!unban <@user>
```

## `!untimeout`
Remove an active timeout restriction from a user early.

**Usage:**
```bash
!untimeout <@user> [reason]
```

## `!unwarn`
Remove a specific warning from a user's record using the Case ID.

**Usage:**
```bash
!unwarn <case_id> [reason]
```
